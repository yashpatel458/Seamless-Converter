# Description

The code is a GUI-based weight, area, length and temperature conversion tool. It imports various modules such as Tkinter, ttk, PIL, etc. to enable GUI development.

- WeightConverter(): This function converts different units of weight. It creates a new window and adds labels, entries, and drop-down menus for input and output units. The function includes a dictionary of factors to multiply to a value to convert from the given units to grams(g). The conversion function converts from a given unit to another using the corresponding factors. When the user clicks the "Calculate" button, the input value is converted to the output unit and the result is displayed in the output field.

- AreaConverter(): This function converts different units of area. It creates a new window and adds labels, entries, and drop-down menus for input and output units. The function includes a dictionary of factors to multiply to a value to convert from the given units to square meters. The conversion function converts from a given unit to another using the corresponding factors. When the user selects the input and output units, enters the input value, and clicks the "Convert" button, the input value is converted to the output unit and the result is displayed in the output field.

- LengthConverter(): This function converts different units of length. It creates a new window and adds labels, entries, and drop-down menus for input and output units. The function includes a dictionary of factors to multiply to a value to convert from the given units to meters. The conversion function converts from a given unit to another using the corresponding factors. When the user selects the input and output units, enters the input value, and clicks the "Convert" button, the input value is converted to the output unit and the result is displayed in the output field.

- TemperatureConverter(): This function converts different units of temperature. It creates a new window and adds labels, entries, and drop-down menus for input and output units. The function includes conversion functions for Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. When the user selects the input and output units, enters the input value, and clicks the "Convert" button, the input value is converted to the output unit and the result is displayed in the output field.
